      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p align="justify">
   Cloud service availability has been one of the
major concerns of cloud service providers (CSP), while
hosting different cloud based information technology
services by managing different resources on the internet.
The vulnerability of internet, the distribute nature of cloud
computing, various security issues related to cloud
computing service models, and cloudâ€™s main attributes
contribute to its susceptibility of security threats
associated with cloud service availability. One of the
major sophisticated threats that happen to be very difficult
and challenging to counter due to its distributed nature
and resulted in cloud service disruption is Distributed
Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Even though there are
number of intrusion detection solutions proposed by
different research groups, and cloud service providers
(CSP) are currently using different detection solutions by
promising that their product is well secured, there is no
such a perfect solution that prevents the DDoS attack. The
characteristics of DDoS attack, i.e., having different
appearance with different scenarios, make it difficult to
detect. This paper will review and analyze different
existing DDoS detecting techniques against different
parameters, discusses their advantage and disadvantages,
and propose a hybrid statistical model that could
significantly mitigate these attacks and be a better
alternative solution for current detection problems.
